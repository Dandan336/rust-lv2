/// A trait to represent an implementation of an URI <-> URID mapper, i.e. that can map an URI
/// (or any C string) to an URID, and vice-versa.
///
/// This trait allows the `Map` and `Unmap` features to be agnostic to the underlying
/// implementation, both on the plugin-side and the host-side.
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// Implementors of this trait have to be clonable, since every instance of a [`MapInterface`](struct.MapInterface.html) or [`UnmapInterface`](struct.UnmapInterface.html) has to own it's own clone of the mapper. This means that, although cloned, the different clones of the mapper have to be consistent: If one clone maps the URI `https://rustup.rs/` to the URID 42, then all of the other clones have to do that too! One way of doing that is to have a common map store contained in a Mutex and shared pointer. See the [`HashURIDMapper`](struct.HashURIDMapper.html) for an example.

/// # Realtime usage
/// As per the LV2 specification, please note that URID mappers are allowed to perform non-realtime
/// operations, such as memory allocation or Mutex locking.
///
/// Therefore, these methods should never be called in a realtime context (such as a plugin's
/// `run()` method). Plugins and other realtime or performance-critical contexts *should* cache IDs
/// they might need at initialization time. See the `URIDCache` for more information on how to
/// achieve this.
