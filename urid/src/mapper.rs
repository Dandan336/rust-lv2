/// operations, such as memory allocation or Mutex locking.
///
/// Therefore, these methods should never be called in a realtime context (such as a plugin's
/// `run()` method). Plugins and other realtime or performance-critical contexts *should* cache IDs
/// they might need at initialization time. See the `URIDCache` for more information on how to
/// achieve this.
