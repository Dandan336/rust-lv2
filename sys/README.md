# rust-lv2's C header bindings.

Bindings to the official [LV2](https://lv2plug.in/) API headers, used by [`rust-lv2`](https://crates.io/crates/lv2), a safe, fast, and ergonomic framework to create [LV2 plugins](http://lv2plug.in/) for audio processing, written in Rust.

## Building

Since the bindings to the raw C headers are generated with bindgen, you need to have [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) installed on your system and, if it isn't in your system's standard path, set the environment variable `LIBCLANG_PATH` to the path of `libClang`.
