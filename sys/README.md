# Raw LV2 API bindings

This crate contains raw bindings of the standard LV2 specifcation API headers. Those were taken from the official [Git repository](https://gitlab.com/lv2/lv2) and generated at compile time using [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

## Building

Since the bindings are generated by bindgen, you need to have [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) installed on your system and, if it isn't in your system's standard path, set the environment variable `LIBCLANG_PATH` to the path of `libClang`.
