# Raw LV2 API bindings

This crate contains the raw bindings of the standard LV2 API headers, version 1.16.0, as published on the [official website](https://lv2plug.in/) ([Tarball](http://lv2plug.in/spec/lv2-1.16.0.tar.bz2)). The bindings are generated at compile time using [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) and therefore exactly match to the headers.

## Building

Since the bindings are generated by bindgen, you need to have [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) installed on your system and, if it isn't in your system's standard path, set the environment variable `LIBCLANG_PATH` to the path of `libClang`.
